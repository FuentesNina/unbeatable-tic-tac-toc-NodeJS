# Node JS Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game... Where a tie is considered a win!

This program was created as one of the self-directed projects from the App Academy Open curriculum.

Please note, some of the code was initially provided: namely, the program's structure and the Screen API (which renders the game onto the terminal). All the classes (apart from Command and Screen) were created by yours truly based on the provided test specs.

What I am most proud of: creating an algorithm for an unbeatable computer opponent. 

To test the different specs files, make sure to first install all dependencies by running `npm install`. Once installed, you can run all the tests through the `mocha` command.

Things that could be added: the option to play against an actual person (can be done by modifying the code in ttt.js.

The algorythm created will be used to enhance the behavior of the React Tic-Tac-Toe game I created previously.
